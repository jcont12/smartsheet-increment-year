Node.js sample for updating date values in Smartsheet

This is a sample shows the following using the (smartsheet-javascript-sdk)[]:

* Get Sheet

## Scenario

This is great, except for the list is getting long, and each year I need to update the year on each date. This script - in implimented as a scheduled cron job - automates that date increment process.
